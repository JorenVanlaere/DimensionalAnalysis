# DimensionalAnalysis
This repository is part research on indoor hydrogen release and dispersion. 4 CFD RANS simulations were computed using ANSYS FLUENT. The details on the simulation setup and post-processed results can be accessed in this repository.

# MODEL
	# Journal file with the details of the model, used for setup in ANSYS FLUENT
	# Mesh files for the four scenarios

# DATA
	# Processed data used for analysis in CSV format
	
	# Vertical distribution of hydrogen at 5 different locations
	# Time series of hydrogen at different non-dimensional points in the domain
	# Time series of flammable volume and total mass of hydrogen
